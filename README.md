PRE-Exercises
=============
I recently started reading <a href=“http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118787315.html”>“Practical Reverse Engineering: x86, x64, ARM, Windows Kernel, Reversing Tools, and Obfuscation”, ISBN: 978-1-118-78731-1</a>

The book contains number of exercises and the authors encourage people to share their solutions. 

This project contains my solutions - write-ups and source code.

I will be using it also to track my progress :)

If you have any comments - let me know.

Enjoy!
